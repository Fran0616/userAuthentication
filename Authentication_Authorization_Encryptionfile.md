Authentication, authorization, and encryption are all key concepts in web security

Authentication
=

Authentication is the verification of who you are. Authentication relies on one or more factors to verify identity, and these factors come in three main types:
- Knowledge is something you know, like a username and password.
- Possession is something you have, like a security card or mobile device
- Inherence is something you are, which generally refers to biometric data such as fingerprints.

Authentication that relies on a single factor, such as a simple username/password combo, is called Single-Factor Authentication, and is becoming increasingly insecure. Authentication that requires multiple factors, such as a username/password combo and a code sent to a mobile device, is known as Multi-Factor Authentication. This is distinct from Multi-Step authentication, which requires multiple types of authentication within a single factor, such as a password and a PIN.

Authorization
=
Authorization is the verification of what you are allowed to do. Authorization is very important for web security, and it is responsible for everything from preventing users from modifying each otherâ€™s accounts, to protecting back-end assets from attackers, to granting limited access to external services.

Encryption 
=
Encryption is the process of transforming data into a format that is unreadable unless you have the correct key to decrypt it. Encryption comes in two main types:
- Symmetric encryption uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data.
- Asymmetric encryption uses separate keys for encryption and decryption.
