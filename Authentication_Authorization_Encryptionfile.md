Authentication is the verification of who you are. Authentication relies on one or more factors to verify identity, and these factors come in three main types:
- Knowledge is something you know, like a username and password.
- Possession is something you have, like a security card or mobile device
- Inherence is something you are, which generally refers to biometric data such as fingerprints.
